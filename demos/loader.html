    * this thing is not working (ripped off from a working app) * (see source)<br/>

    i have node.js with express and socket io
    and a simple website, a website like wordpress, distant, on a different server.
    i wanted to integrate a socket io app into it.
    
    using $script i could develop a javascript application and make it embedable in any page.    
    
    on your server you have the loader.js (can be named as your app .js) the loader file which containes
    a minified $script and it loades all other scripts.
    then on a distant page you have something like this: 
    <!--code-->
    <div id="container"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://123.123.123.123:5051/loader.js"></script>
    <!--code-->
  </body>
</html>
